# xcoin
2p2 distributed marketplace for digital assets

##To install

Setup instructions (plz update if not working)
- install go at least 1.8
- ```go get -u github.com/ZaneWithSpoon/xcoin```
- This will download the xcoin repo to your $GOPATH/src folder, and install the xcoin binaries in your $GOPATH/bin folder.


^^^^ None of that works ^^^^
1. install go
2. navigate to your $GOPATH/src folder
3. git clone this project
4. ```cd xcoin```
5. ```go git``` (kinda like npm install)

##To run

1. cd $GOPATH/src
2. xcoin is your executable binary
3. run ```./xcoin daemon```
